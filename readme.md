## Motivation

<!-- Why did I make this -->

Often I find myself watching videos on youtube which contain reminders that a better, longer, ad-free version exists on nebula, a platform that I subscribe to. Often these reminders at near the end of videos and so there is little point going back to see the differences. By building a database of video pairs, recognizing them in the browser and offering an easy redirect users can benefit from the fantastic service that they already pay for
